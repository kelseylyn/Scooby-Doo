		<h3>The Black Knight</h3>
		<img class="monster" src="img/blackknight.jpg"/>
	
			<p>This was the first monster that we see the gang investigate. The Black Knight was haunting the
				local museum and there was also a disappearance of Professor Hyde White. During investigation we see two of Shaggy's special skills. He used his gymnastics
				skills to get in the museum after hours and he use ventriloquism to trick The Black Knight. The meddlesome
				kids caught and unmasked The Black Knight who was Mr.Wickles, a man that worked at the museum. He used The 
				Black Knight to scare people away so no one would discover his paint forgeries. "What a Night for a Knight" 09/13/1969
